    "# Face Recognition for the Happy House\n",

    "Welcome to the first assignment of week 4! Here you will build a face recognition system. Many of the ideas presented here are from [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). In lecture, we also talked about [DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Face Verification** - \"is this the claimed person?\". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. \n",
    "- **Face Recognition** - \"who is this person?\". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**In this assignment, you will:**\n",
    "- Implement the triplet loss function\n",
    "- Use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings\n",
    "- Use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will be using a pre-trained model which represents ConvNet activations using a \"channels first\" convention, as opposed to the \"channels last\" convention used in lecture and previous programming assignments. In other words, a batch of images will be of shape $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W)$ instead of $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$. Both of these conventions have a reasonable amount of traction among open-source implementations; there isn't a uniform standard yet within the deep learning community. \n",
